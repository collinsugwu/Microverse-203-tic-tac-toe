# Microverse-203-tic-tac-toe

This is the 3rd project of the Main Ruby curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org)

Remember Tic Tac Toe? See Wikipedia if you can’t remember the rules, or if you haven’t ever played. It involves a couple of players, a simple board, checking for victory in a game loop… all the conditions that make it a fun little problem to solve using our newfound OOP sea legs. Let’s build it!
